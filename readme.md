# Contentstack Code Generation

This utility examines a Contentstack account and generates code based on
the content types that it finds:

1. JSON Schema
2. TypeScript interfaces
3. Validation code

The JSON schema is broadly applicable and should be usable in any environment
with tooling to support it, for instance, it could be used with Newtonsoft.JSON
in a dotnet tool chain.

The TypeScript interfaces provide an alternative to those generated by the
Contentstack CLI Tsgen plugin.

The validation code is intended for run-time validation of entities received
through the Contentstack REST endpoint. The validation code will ensure that
the entities you receive match the interfaces that your code was compiled
against.

## TODO

- Per-interface validation code.
